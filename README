Log-Any-For-Std

Log::Any provides convenient API for logging of messages. But to ensure
recording of a message into the log you have to evidently call out one of the
logging methods, e.g $log->info('some message').

At the same time it is often needed in programs to log a message which you
evidently didn't output. For example it may be a message output by the
interpreter STDERR as a result of an error.

The module Log::Any::For::Std  logs your messages for you. You can just
write in your application 'use Log::Any::For::Std'; and all the standard error
messages will start logging magically.
